              Kampung Cloud is a place that brings people together - those in
              need and those that want to help. Whether itâ€™s a loaf of bread, a
              roll of toilet paper, or a carton of eggs, we believe that every
              little act of kindness can make a difference in these times of
              need. Send in a request or fulfil a request. We can all get by
              with a little help sometimes.
